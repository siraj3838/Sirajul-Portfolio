                I am Sirajul Islam. My home is Brahmanbaria, Bangladesh. When I gave SSC I was more interested in computers and more interested in coding. Since then I have been trying to learn about coding and it is one of my favorite hobbies. I don't like to waste time on anything. So enrolled in Complete Web Development course at Programming Hero and completed the course on time. The duration of the course was 6 months and I gave 12 assignments within the ontime. Many pacers have gone. Actually I adapted everything because I love coding. I have the mindset to learn more about coding features. Because my dream is to become a good developer. So if I learn something by working hard it will be a force for my improvement
